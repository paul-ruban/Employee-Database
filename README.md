# Emplyee-Database
A basic employee database in JAVA - sort, search, update, insert, delete algorithms

1. First random data is generated in the txt file.
2. Then, a heap and a BST are created to help sorting by ID and SIN number.
3. The app allows sorting, adding, modifying and deleting employees from the DB.
4. When adding, ID collision and SIN verifications are carried out.
5. This is a pocket project, done in IntelliJ IDEA to practice algorithms.
